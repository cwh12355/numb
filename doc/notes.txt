# implicit multiplication rules

Implicit multiplication applies only if
the right-hand side is a word:

    10 kg
    (1000 + 1) nights
    foo(123) metre
    1 thousand puppies

Having global implicit multiplication
leads to ambiguity between function calls
and grouping parantheses:

    foo(bar)
    # foo * (bar)    multiplication
    # foo(bar)       ... or function call?

which `frink` had to resolve by
introducing square brackets for function calls.

Besides, implicit multiplication's sole purpose is
to make unit operations look more "natural".



# implicit multiplication precedence

While some projects (like `insect`, `mathjs`)
have a higher precedence
for implicit multiplication than division
to prevent certain confusion, like:

    # how many pieces do i get if I split
    # 1 metre rope so that each has 20 cm
    1 m / 20 cm = 5

this still causes misunderstandings when dealing
with multidimensional units:

    # how much time does it take to download
    # 10 GB file over 10 MB/s broadband
    10GB / 10MB/s

Hence `numb`'s implicit multiplication precedence is
the same as the explicit multiplication and division
(as in `frink`).
